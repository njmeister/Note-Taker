# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge  -- Note Taker

## Description

This is my submission for the Note Taker challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. This challenge aimed to create a website allowing users to save notes to a database using express.js.

## Installation

N/A



## Usage

Opening the application presents the user with a landing page with a link to a notes page. Clicking on the link takes the user to a new page with a list of previous notes displayed in a left column and empty fields to create a new note on the right. Two buttons will appear in the nav bar once the user has typed in a note. One saves the note and adds it to the list; the other clears the forms. Clicking on one of the previously created notes will pull up its title and text in the right-hand column instead of the empty fields. When a note is pulled up, a button appears in the nav bar that will revert the right column to empty fields to take a new note. If the red trashcans on the note list are clicked, the corresponding note is deleted from the database.
